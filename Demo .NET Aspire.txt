DEMO

- Create new Project WeatherApp.Aspire in the resistent project
- Add Aspire Orchestrator Support --> the warning that pop's up means that we already have orchestration, 
  because we hav this project --> use this apphost project the service defaults --> configure everthing by default for you 
- The moment that we do that, we go back to the Program.cs file (WeatherApp.Aspire.AppHost) --> the weather app is add to the project 
  so that the apphost is aware that I want --> run some WebProject --> exsist in this namespace Weather App 
- Also in the program.cs in the WeatherApp.web is this add Service Default (builder.AddServiceDefaults();) call, which will add all the service defaults from that 
  WeatherApp.Aspire Service Deafults Project --> in the this extension method will be called.
- In the program.cs Weatherapp.Web plenty of differents things --> in the bottom there is app.MapDefaultEndpoint --> some endpoints needed for aspire
  just orchestrate everything and function that is it now --> the same thing for the WeatherApi --> also reference to the API
- (WeatherApp.Aspire.Apphost) No we make a reference to the API this help the wiring up of the Web Project being aware that the API exist.
- We go to WeatherApp.Web refer to  this addres so this it the weatherapi. (10:06 gestopt)
